# td_wm

Creating working memory for autonomous systems with temporal difference learning. 

Working memory is based on the interactions between the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia.

The perceived world of the agent is encoded in hrrs and passed through a neural network. 

Decisions for state movement are made with Reinforcement learning. 

All parameters can be changed in the jupyter notebook files. 

Currently working on combining abstract representations and direct wm to task.
